Made the sidebar and moved it to the right side of every page.
Also transfered the blog from the main page to the .txt file so I can modify one file and it will apply to every single existance of the viewable blog.

I revisited some aspects of the website and tweaked some values of some code.

I finally made the website into awhole. Before it was just some parts there and somewhere else. 
Now it's all connected so well that sometimes you can't tell that you are switching the files.

The website idea was started. I made the index.html and begin coding taking one of my works as a template. 
As I am pretty pro at coding and stuff, it was pretty easy. Until it wasen't ofc. 
The original idea was made by me and RdoLmt when we were chatting in discord and I got a good idea to make cursed pictures of people, mainly about gynaecologists.
