            I finally made the website into awhole. Before it was just some parts there and somewhere else. <br>
            Now it's all connected so well that sometimes you can't tell that you are switching the files.

            The website idea was started. I made the index.html and begin coding taking one of my works as a template. <br>
            As I am pretty pro at coding and stuff, it was pretty easy. Until it wasen't ofc. <br>
            The original idea was made by me and RdoLmt when we were chatting in discord and I got a good idea to make cursed pictures of people, mainly about gynaecologists.
